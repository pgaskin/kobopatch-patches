[U][B]Changes to the kobopatch zip:[/B][/U]
[B]v74 (2022-01-21)[/B]: Improved "Unify font sizes" values (sherman), minor improvements to patch comments and descriptions (jackie_w, nkakouros).
[B]v73 (2021-11-02)[/B]: Backport "Unify font sizes" from 4.30.18838 (sherman), add note about "Replace adobe page numbers toggle with invert screen" in 4.28.18220+ (geek1011).
[B]v72 (2021-10-21)[/B]: Initial release for 4.28.18220.

[B][U]Missing patches:[/U][/B]
- None!

[B][U]Removed patches in this version:[/U][/B]
- geek1011: ePub uniform font scale (this will need a complete rewrite for 18220+ since the logic has been completely reworked; also note that it may not be necessary on certain devices anymore; this patch has been at least partially replaced by `Unify font sizes`)
- GeoffR: Set font scale factor (same reason)

[B][U]New patches in this version:[/U][/B]
- sherman: Unify font sizes (mostly replaces "ePub uniform font scale", fixes the font scaling in EPUBs to not be absurdly large on some devices and to be consistent with KEPUBs) (backported from 4.30.18838)

[B][U]Other notes:[/U][/B]
- I do not recommend mixing and matching kobo8 (Elipsa) and kobo3-7 firmware. There are non-insignificant differences in the rootfs which may cause issues. For example, Foxit is used for PDFs on the Elipsa, but it isn't included at all on non-kobo8 packages.
