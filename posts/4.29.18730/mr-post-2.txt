[B][U]New patches in this version:[/U][/B]

[B][U]Other notes:[/U][/B]
- I do not recommend mixing and matching kobo8/9 (Elipsa, Libra2, Sage) and kobo3-7 firmware. There are non-insignificant differences in the rootfs which may cause issues. For example, Foxit is used for PDFs on the Elipsa, but it isn't included at all on non-kobo8/9 packages.
- If you install kobo8/9 firmware on an older device, you may run into [URL="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=4164605&postcount=35"]space issues[/URL] (thanks for pointing this out, @davidfor).
