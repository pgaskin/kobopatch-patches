KePub constant font sharpness (Font anti-aliasing):
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      With this patch the KePub reader will use a constant sharpness value of 0.2,
      instead of the value set by the advanced font sharpness/weight slider. The
      slider sharpness values range from -0.4(min.) to 0.2(max.), default -0.0666.
      Despite the slider range, the value set by this patch could go past the range,
      however large values may start to break the font apart, feel free to fine tune
      this value. The sharpness actually refers to how much anti-aliasing Kobo would
      use, less anti-aliasing would make the font appear sharper, but the curvatures
      of the font would appear jagged. So tuning this value *down* (Use *more* anti-
      aliasing) makes sense, but this doesn't work indefinitely as the system would
      start to just add blur instead of doing anything.
