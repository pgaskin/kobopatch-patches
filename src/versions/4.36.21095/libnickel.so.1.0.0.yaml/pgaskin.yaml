  # nop the branch for checking if left-to-right (so it always runs the swap of back/forward)
  - ReplaceBytes: {Offset:  4, FindH: 18 B9, ReplaceInstNOP: true}
  # where r3 = *(r7+0x18) (back) and r2 = *(r7+0x20) (forward), then they are stored in reverse,

  # This patch could have also been done later on where the tap point is checked against different
  # QRects, but that's a lot more complicated due to the use of QHash s of pointers to functions.

Increase page navigation history:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: Increases the number of dots marking navigation history on the scrubber.

Replace adobe page numbers toggle with invert screen:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Replaces the adobe page numbers toggle in reading settings with an invert
      screen one. Due to recent firmware changes (since 18220, it is set by the
      kobo QPA during initialization), it will only take effect after a reboot.

Allow USB storage even when device locked:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Always allows USB storage even when the device is locked. When combined
      with an enabled lock screen, this patch allows recovery from almost any
      segfaulting patch without a factory reset, as most code isn't executed
      until after the initial unlock. WARNING - this patches renders the lock
      screen security completely useless! But, for some security by obscurity
      this will only take effect when you plug it in while the sleep screen is
      visible.

      PM me (geek1011) on MobileRead, and I'll fix it.
  # QVariant::toBool is called after getting the setting (of if it has/should

## Change Browse Kobo home screen link target ###
# This patch allows you to change the target of the Browse Kobo link. To
# rename the top description, use the rename home screen footer patch.
#
# The easy options for this patch are fairly limited, as BrowseKoboWidget::tapped
# just calls the superclass event, then the call to DiscoverNavMixin::storeFront
# in the PLT is tail-call optimized. This places a number of restrictions on the
# replacement target, namely: the branch must be a branch and exchange, but not
# link (lr must be unchanged to return correctly), which is implemented as a
# 32-bit branch to a bx pc (nop branch, but still switch instruction sets)
# immediately before a PLT entry to a nav mixin without any arguments (i.e.
# must be static). Note that the first branch is relative to pc. Also, note that
# in general, this requirement means anything called by StatusBarController (the
# menu) can be used as a replacement.
#
# Basically, the following two steps are needed:
# - In BrowseKoboWidget::tapped, change the tail-call to the bx before
#   [something]NavMixin::[something] in the PLT.
# - In the BrowseKoboWidget constructor, change which function is called to get
#   the bottom text (Shop Kobo) from N3DeviceCharm::shopName (Shop Kobo / Walmart)
#   to N3DeviceCharm::[something] (note that there isn't enough room to
#   load an entirely different string here).

# Note: The "Increase TOC level indentation" and "Increase TOC level indentation
# and fix extra indentation bug" patches are not necessary anymore in firmware
# 4.24.15672+ and have been removed since the fixes have been integrated into
# the original firmware. The default indentation is now around 3x larger than it
# was before (and it scales for each device), and the firmware will always
# subtract 1 from the depth before applying the indentation (since it's indexed
# from 1+ rather than 0+).
#
# If you are not happy with the new defaults, see the new "Change TOC level
# indentation" patch in nickel.yaml.

  # This one is slightly unusual in that the reading header also shares the
  # ReadingFooter code (ReadingView::updateProgressHeader only has the page
  # text, and it ends with a branch to ReadingFooter::update). This means we
  # only have to patch one place, but it also means you can't have the title in
  # one, but not the other.
  #
  # We'll patch this in a slightly hacky and inefficient, but simple and
  # easy-to-update way by replacing the first QString::append (the dash) with a
  # QString::resize to zero (I would have done a QString::clear, but that symbol
  # isn't imported):

Larger Sleep/Power-off timeouts:
  - Enabled: no
  - PatchGroup: Sleep/Power-off timeouts
  - Description: |
      Increase the available sleep/power-off timeouts to larger values (up to a
      few weeks). To customize this patch, see https://pgaskin.net/kobopatch-patches/lgrpwroff-15505.html .

      IMPORTANT - Although this patch has been tested by multiple users and
      confirmed to be working, the interaction between the RTC timer and Nickel
      has many moving parts. As reported by JSWolf on MR, this patch might have
      issues with actually powering-off with timeouts longer than a day. The
      cause is likely to be the auto-sync interval or sleepcover causing the
      timer to be overridden/reset every day. Nevertheless, this patch should
      work reliably for timeouts under 12 hours, and probably under 1 day.

      If you are using this patch with timeouts above 12 hours, and can confirm
      if it works/doesn't work, please PM me or comment on GitHub with your
      setting values, sleepcover or not, auto-sync interval, wifi on/off, firmware
      version, and Kobo model.

Allow rotation on all devices:

Swap reading header/footer:

  # the overloaded ReadingFooter::update function. The difference is which r0 (this)

  # and they are loaded just before the update (and aren't used otherwise), they
  # can be swapped by switching the struct offset used by LDR.

Customize ComfortLight settings:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Change the times available in the ComfortLight bedtime dropdown and the
      start/end times for the color changes. All values in this patch are
      customizable.

      The default values for this patch give you 21 options between 5PM and 3AM
      at 30 minute intervals, with the colour change starting at 4PM, and the
      change back to blue between 5AM and 7AM. The firmware default is 13 options
      between 9PM-3AM at 30 minute intervals, with the transition starting at 6PM.
  ##
