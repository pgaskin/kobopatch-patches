# The following patch(es) are ported from GeoffR's patch zips

# The next 2 patches are alternatives.
# Beware that the KePub reader has problems with its page break position
# when narrow line spacings are selected, depending on which font is used.
# You can increase the replace_float values at the bottom of each patch to
# avoid those problems, or else simply refrain from selecting narrowest
# line spacings when reading KePubs.

ePub fixed top/bottom margins:
  - Enabled: no
  - PatchGroup: ePub padding-bottom alternatives
  - Description:
      This patch sets the @page margin sizes in epubs to fixed custom values,
      overriding any @page margin set in the book's CSS stylesheet. (But beware
      that some books also set page margins in an XPGT stylesheet which are added
      to any CSS @page margins, and those will not be affected by this patch).

ePub disable built-in body padding-bottom:
  - Enabled: no
  - PatchGroup: ePub padding-bottom alternatives
  - Description: |
      The built-in ePub stylesheet adds a line of padding at the bottom of the
      body element, to prevent the chapter ending on the last line of a page.
      This patch disables that stylesheet entry.
      
      This patch is not compatible with `ePub fixed/adjustable top/bottom margins`
      patch, which already removes this stylesheet entry to make room for other
      things.

  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Sets the built-in minimum margin for KePub books and Pocket articles to
      zero, the same as it is in ePub books. This only affects left/right margins

Block WiFi firmware upgrade:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      WARNING! THIS IS A DANGEROUS PATCH! READ THE INFORMATION BELOW CAREFULLY!
      
      THIS PATCH IS UNTESTED, as there is no way to be sure it still works until
      the next firmware version is released. If it works then the firmware will
      not be upgraded during a WiFi sync, but you will still be able to upgrade
      manually or by syncing with the Kobo desktop.
      
      THIS PATCH COULD RESULT IN A BOOT LOOP when signing out of your Kobo account
      (Settings > Accounts > Sign out) or when invoking a factory reset from the
      device information menu (Settings > Device information > Factory reset).
      REMOVE THIS PATCH BEFORE USING EITHER OF THOSE OPTIONS.
      A factory reset invoked using the hardware methods (such as holding down the
      light button while switching on) should not be affected.
  - FindReplaceString:
      Find:    "UpgradeCheck/%1/%2/%3/%4/%5"
      Replace: "UpgradeCheck/%1/%2/k/99.9/5"

Custom footer (page number text):
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Shortens the page number text in the reading footer, and perhaps elsewhere.
      E.g. "Page 1 of 2" becomes "1 / 2" (not sure how it affects translations)
  - FindReplaceString: {Find: "Page %1 <i>of</i> %2", Replace: "%1 / %2"}

Custom Sleep/Power-off timeouts:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Changes the Sleep/Power-off timeout menu options from 5,10,15,30,45,60
      minutes to 10,20,30,60,120,240 minutes.

Set KePub hyphenation:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      The built-in KePub stylesheet has a line * { -webkit-hyphens: auto; }
      to turn on hyphenation, but it is only used if the device's justification
      button is set to full justification. With this patch enabled hyphenation
      will always be turned on, regardless of justification button setting.
      
      (The publisher can still turn hyphenation off/on in the book's stylesheet.)
  - ReplaceBytes: {Offset: 0x9EF28C, FindH: 36 F6 A6 E6, ReplaceH: 01 20 01 20} # Alternative 1: Always turn KePub hyphenation on
# - ReplaceBytes: {Offset: 0x9EF28C, FindH: 36 F6 A6 E6, ReplaceH: 00 20 00 20} # Alternative 2: Never turn KePub hyphenation on

Fix three KePub fullScreenReading bugs:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: See http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=3113460&postcount=16
    ## In full-screen reading mode (when the FullScreenReading feature setting is
    ## activated and the "Show header and footer" reading setting is unticked) the
    ## KePub reader has three problems:
    ##
    ## 1. If the book's stylesheet has non-zero body margin/padding, then the
    ##    text is shifted to the right and can be cut off at the right margin.
    ## 2. Characters with large side bearing values (such as italic f, J) can
    ##    be cut off if they appear at either end of a line.
    ## 3. Images which are supposed to be displayed inline (flowing with the text)
    ##    are instead displayed centred in a seperate block.
    ##
    ## This patch fixes those problems by replacing the following faulty style,
    ## which is the cause of problem 3.:
    ##
    ##   img {
    ##     display: block;
    ##     margin-left: auto !important;
    ##     margin-right: auto !important;
    ##     width: auto !important;
    ##     height: auto !important;
    ##   }
    ##
    ## with the following two styles, which work around problems 1. and 2.:
    ##
    ##   body {
    ##     margin: 0 !important;
    ##     padding: 0 !important;
    ##   }
    ##
    ##   body>div {
    ##     padding-left: 0.2em !important;
    ##     padding-right: 0.2em !important;
    ##   }
  - FindReplaceString:
      Find:    "img { display: block; margin-left: auto !important; margin-right: auto !important; width: auto !important; height: auto !important; }"
      Replace: "body { margin: 0 !important; padding: 0 !important; }  body>div { padding-left: 0.2em !important; padding-right:  0.2em !important; }"
    # Optional replacement values below (all relate to the second problem above):
    # set the amount of added padding: `1` = 0.1em, `2` = 0.2em, etc.
    # 0.1em is enough for many fonts, but some (such as Georgia) need 0.2em.
  - ReplaceString: {Offset: 0x52, Find: "2", Replace: "2"}

    # Uncomment the following two replace_string lines for vertical languages only:
# - ReplaceString: {Offset: 0x4A, Find: "left:", Replace: "top:\x20"}
# - ReplaceString: {Offset: 0x6A, Find: "right: ", Replace: "bottom:"}
    # ... or the following two replace_string lines for both horizontal and vertical
    # languages: (But note that this will cause the padding to be added at the
    # beginning/end of each chapter too.)
# - ReplaceString: {Offset: 0x49, Find: "-left:", Replace: ":    \x20"}

    # Sideloaded KePubs created with old versions of the KoboTouchExtended driver,
    # and perhaps some other KePubs that haven't been through Kobo's EPUB2 to KEPUB
    # conversion process, might not have a wrapper div to apply the padding styles
    # to. Uncomment the following line to work around the second problem for these
    # KePubs too. (But beware, this can have unwanted side effects such as extra
    # space between paragraphs if the above option for both horizontal and vertical
    # languages is uncommented too.)
# - ReplaceString: {Offset: 0x3C, Find: "div", Replace:"* \x20"}

Force user line spacing in KePubs:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      This patch will allow the line spacing set by the slider to take effect
      in some problem KePub books with fixed linespacing (including ones where the
      publisher has used <div> instead of <p> for paragraphs, or wrapped each
      paragraph in a <span> and set the line-height on the span.) However it might
      also override some line spacing that would better be left fixed, e.g. it can
      cause problems with the spacing of paragraphs that begin with a raise-cap.
    # body, p { line-height: %1 ... }  -->  body *  { line-height: %1 ... }
  - FindBaseAddressString: "body, p { line-height: %1"
  - ReplaceString: {Offset: 0, Find: "body, p {", Replace: "body *  {"}
    #
    # Option: Comment out the replace_string line above and uncomment the one below
    # for a less forceful version of this patch that has fewer side effects and
    # should still work for most problem books, but not the ones where the publisher
    # has set the line-height at <span> level.
    #
    # body, p { line-height: %1 ... }  -->  body,div,p{line-height:%1 ... }
# - ReplaceString: {Offset: 0, Find: "body, p { line-height: %", Replace: "body,div,p{line-height:%"}

      This patch prevents any line-height style set in the book's stylesheet from

      This patch prevents any font-family style set in the book's stylesheet from
      being recognised. It might spoil the style of books which use multiple fonts,
      but will ensure that the font-family set from the device menu takes effect.

Un-Force user font-family in KePubs:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      The KePub reader uses a very heavy-handed method of setting the font selected
      by the user, overriding all fonts set by the publisher in the book unless
      "Publisher Default" is selected.
      This patch lets the font-family set by the publisher in the KePub stylesheet
      override the font-family selected by the reader from the device in some
      cases, which allows a mix of user-selected and publisher-selected fonts.
      Alternatives 1-3 give increasing preference to the publisher-selected fonts.
