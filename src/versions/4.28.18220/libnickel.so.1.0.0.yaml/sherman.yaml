Unify font sizes:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Attempt to unify the font sizes between epub and kepub. Without this patch 
      epub font sizes can be much larger than kepub at the same size setting.
  
  # From my current understanding, the final font size for epubs is calculated as follows:
  # ( font_size / scale_factor ) * DPI, where 'scale_factor' = 25.0. It seems RMSDK must 
  # be handling DPI elsewhere however, because the DPI multiplication here seems to have a 
  # detrimental effect, and behaves differenly on different devices.
  # This patch changes the 'scale_factor' to 1.0, and replaces the call to get DPI with 
  # a constant multiplier (6.5). Note, that the replacement values are limited to 
  # 0.25 - 31.0 in 0.25 increments. 
  # Refer to https://github.com/pgaskin/kobopatch-patches/issues/96 for more information.
