Unify font sizes:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Attempt to unify the font sizes between epub and kepub. Without this patch
      epub font sizes can be much larger than kepub at the same size setting.
    # From my current understanding, the final font size for epubs is calculated
    # as follows: ( font_size / scale_factor ) * DPI, where 'scale_factor' =
    # 25.0. It seems RMSDK must be handling DPI elsewhere however, because the
    # DPI multiplication here seems to have a detrimental effect, and behaves
    # differently on different devices. This patch changes the 'scale_factor' to
    # 2.5, and replaces the call to get DPI with a constant multiplier (16).
    # The results of using these values are equivalent to  
    # ( font_size / 15.0 ) * 96 which is what I suspect the kepub formula is.
    # Note, that the replacement values are limited to 0.25 - 31.0 in 0.25
    # increments.
