Custom font sizes:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Changes the range of sizes on the font size slider so that there are more of
      the small sizes and fewer of the large sizes.
      With this patch enabled you will not be able to select the very large font
      sizes, but will be able to make finer adjustment to the smaller sizes.
    # Font sizes depend on the device's screen resolution. Unpatched, the sizes
    # increase in steps of 1 from the smallest size up to size 22, then in steps
    # of 2 up to size 50, then in steps of 4 up to the largest size:

ePub disable built-in body padding-bottom:
  - Enabled: no
  - PatchGroup: ePub padding-bottom alternatives
  - Description: |
      The built-in ePub stylesheet adds a line of padding at the bottom of the
      body element, to prevent the chapter ending on the last line of a page.
      This patch disables that stylesheet entry.
      
      This patch is not compatible with `ePub fixed/adjustable top/bottom margins`
      patch, which already removes this stylesheet entry to make room for other

Block WiFi firmware upgrade:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      WARNING! THIS IS A DANGEROUS PATCH! READ THE INFORMATION BELOW CAREFULLY!
      
      THIS PATCH IS UNTESTED, as there is no way to be sure it still works until
      the next firmware version is released. If it works then the firmware will
      not be upgraded during a WiFi sync, but you will still be able to upgrade
      manually or by syncing with the Kobo desktop.
      
      THIS PATCH COULD RESULT IN A BOOT LOOP when signing out of your Kobo account
      (Settings > Accounts > Sign out) or when invoking a factory reset from the
      device information menu (Settings > Device information > Factory reset).
      REMOVE THIS PATCH BEFORE USING EITHER OF THOSE OPTIONS.
      A factory reset invoked using the hardware methods (such as holding down the
      light button while switching on) should not be affected.
  - FindReplaceString:

Custom footer (page number text):
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Shortens the page number text in the reading footer, and perhaps elsewhere.
      E.g. "Page 1 of 2" becomes "1 / 2" (not sure how it affects translations)
  - FindReplaceString: {Find: "Page %1 <i>of</i> %2", Replace: "%1 / %2"}

Set KePub hyphenation:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      The built-in KePub stylesheet has a line * { -webkit-hyphens: auto; }
      to turn on hyphenation, but it is only used if the device's justification
      button is set to full justification. With this patch enabled hyphenation
      will always be turned on, regardless of justification button setting.
      
      (The publisher can still turn hyphenation off/on in the book's stylesheet.)

Fix three KePub fullScreenReading bugs:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: See http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=3113460&postcount=16
    ## This patch may not be needed anymore since firmware 4.11.11911, as there is now
    ## an officially supported option to disable headers and footers, which doesn't seem
    ## to have this bug.
    ##
    ## In full-screen reading mode (when the FullScreenReading feature setting is
    ## activated and the "Show header and footer" reading setting is unticked) the
    ## KePub reader has three problems:
    ##
    ## 1. If the book's stylesheet has non-zero body margin/padding, then the
    ##    text is shifted to the right and can be cut off at the right margin.
    ## 2. Characters with large side bearing values (such as italic f, J) can
    ##    be cut off if they appear at either end of a line.
    ## 3. Images which are supposed to be displayed inline (flowing with the text)
    ##    are instead displayed centred in a seperate block.
    ##
    ## This patch fixes those problems by replacing the following faulty style,
    ## which is the cause of problem 3.:
    ##
    ##   img {
    ##     display: block;
    ##     margin-left: auto !important;
    ##     margin-right: auto !important;
    ##     width: auto !important;
    ##     height: auto !important;
    ##   }
    ##
    ## with the following two styles, which work around problems 1. and 2.:
    ##
    ##   body {
    ##     margin: 0 !important;
    ##     padding: 0 !important;
    ##   }
    ##
    ##   body>div {

Force user line spacing in KePubs:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      This patch will allow the line spacing set by the slider to take effect
      in some problem KePub books with fixed linespacing (including ones where the
      publisher has used <div> instead of <p> for paragraphs, or wrapped each
      paragraph in a <span> and set the line-height on the span.) However it might
      also override some line spacing that would better be left fixed, e.g. it can
      cause problems with the spacing of paragraphs that begin with a raise-cap.
    # body, p { line-height: %1 ... }  -->  body *  { line-height: %1 ... }
  - FindBaseAddressString: "body, p { line-height: %1"

    # for a less forceful version of this patch that has fewer side effects and
    # should still work for most problem books, but not the ones where the publisher
    # has set the line-height at <span> level.

Un-Force user text-align in div,p tags in KePubs:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      This patch allows the text alignment set by the publisher in the kepub
      stylesheet to override the alignment selected by the reader from the device.
    #     div, p { text-align: %1 !important; }

Always display chapter name on navigation menu:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Normally the <-> navigation menu only displays the current chapter name if
      [Reading settings > Display progress for:] is set to 'Current Chapter'.
      This patch causes the current chapter name to be displayed if 'Entire book'
      progress is selected as well. Works for both ePub and KePub books.
    # in ReadingMenuScrubberController::setChapterAndProgressText(...)

Un-Force user font-family in KePubs:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      The KePub reader uses a very heavy-handed method of setting the font selected
      by the user, overriding all fonts set by the publisher in the book unless
      "Publisher Default" is selected.
      This patch lets the font-family set by the publisher in the KePub stylesheet
      override the font-family selected by the reader from the device in some
      cases, which allows a mix of user-selected and publisher-selected fonts.
      Alternatives 1-3 give increasing preference to the publisher-selected fonts.
  - FindBaseAddressString: "* { font-family: %1 !important; }\n"
    #

      Find: "* { font-family: %1 !important; }\n"
      Replace: "div,p{font-family:%1!important; }\n"

#     Replace: "body,p{font-family:%1!important;}\n"
#     MustMatchLength: yes

    # Alternative 3: (similar to ePub with `Un-force font-family override p tags`)
    #     * { font-family: %1 !important; }\n
    # --> body{font-family:%1 !important; }\n
# - ReplaceString:

Change dicthtml strings to micthtml:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      This patch is used for something to do with syncing and custom dictionaries.
      If you don't know what it does, then you probably don't need it.
  - ReplaceString: {Offset: 0xCE1D8C, Find: "%1/dicthtml%2", Replace: "%1/micthtml%2"}
  - ReplaceString: {Offset: 0xCE1D9C, Find: "dicthtml", Replace: "micthtml"}

Allow searches on Extra dictionaries:
  - Enabled: no
    ## To allow searches on Extra dictionaries change space character at end of
    ## "Extra: " to another char (ex: "Extra:_")
    ## The space char causes a non-desired "English - English" when searching on
    ## Extra dictionary from main menu.
  - FindBaseAddressString: "\0Extra:\x20"
  - ReplaceString: {Offset: 7, Find: "\x20", Replace: "_"}

Clock display duration:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      When the reading footer menu is opened a clock is displayed at the top left
      for 3 seconds before being replaced with the reading progress percentage.
      This patch changes the length of time the clock is displayed to 5 seconds.

ePub uniform font scale:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      This patch makes the ePub reader use the same font scale on all devices,
      the same as the KePub reader does. Without this patch the ePub reader uses
      a 50% larger font size on AuraHD/H2O/GloHD/Clara (and Aura?) devices.

Set font scale factor:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      This patch sets the font scale factor for ePub and KePub readers.
      See also `ePub uniform font scale` and `Custom font sizes` patches.
  # Font scale factor is calculated as (font size slider) / (X+32)
  # Original value X=14, so original scale factor is (font size slider) / 46.
  # Allowed replacement values for X: 0-15 (smaller X --> larger scale factor)
  # ePub:
  - ReplaceInt: {Offset: 0x4A99F2, Find: 14, Replace: 8}
  # KePub:
  - ReplaceInt: {Offset: 0xA2C7F0, Find: 14, Replace: 8}

# Note to GeoffR (from: geek1011): I don't have the time or patience to fix all
# the keyboard patches which broke this version. I did look into it for a bit,
# so here's what I have so far:
# - Base address is the same (C3BD0000C3BF0000C5A10000C5BE0000 = 0xD14CE8).
# - Offset of second row keys is -0x8 compared to before.
# - Offset of third and fourth row is at least that much less.
# - I'm not certain if these locations are referenced anywhere else in the code
#   now.
# - The sharp key offset is 0x93AC5C.
# - The script key offset is 0x93ACB2.
# - The offset changes were probably due to the addition of a Kanji keyboard.
