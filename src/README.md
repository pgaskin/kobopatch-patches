# src
This directory stores the source code of the patches. The patch zips are generated from the files in this folder, and are automatically updated in the [releases](https://github.com/geek1011/kobopatch-patches/releases) every time a tagged commit is made.

## Updating existing patches
To update or add to existing patches, add it to the relevant file for your version. If you want write access to this repository, ask me (PM me on MobileRead or email me).

## Writing patches for a new version
To write patches for a new version, make a copy of the most recent version, rename it, and start updating the patches. If a patch does not work, comment it out until it does. Once a version is ready, you can tag a release.
